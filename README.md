# DMM_Boss_HiScores_Webscraper
Webscraper & Excel dashbaord for hunting people to player-kill on old school runescape. This allows one to gauge if a boss has activity and displays the variance. Reduced 64 bosses down to 18 due to limitations on jagex's anti-bot/spam scraping protection measures. No proxy server needed.

Also included pk_waiting ahk to click a player quickly just once when they appear to you in-game
